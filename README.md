# My-New-Repo

First online project, where I will do some basic exploratory data analysis on cars in the US.

This will require streamlit, plotly express, and pandas libraries.

The app url is: https://info-on-cars-in-the-us-via-streamlit.onrender.com

Hopefully all you have to do is click the link to run the app.
