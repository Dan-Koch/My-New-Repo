# My-New-Repo

First online project, where I will do some basic exploratory data analysis on cars in the US.

The app url is: https://info-on-cars-in-the-us-via-streamlit.onrender.com
It may take a while for the website to load.

The code will require streamlit, plotly express, and pandas libraries.
To run the app locally you would need to pull App.py and vehicles_us.csv.
Then in the command terminal change the directory("cd") to the folder where you have stored those files.
Type "streamlit run App.py" 


Thank you for your patience and help.
